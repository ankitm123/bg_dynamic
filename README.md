# bg_dynamic

This code changes the background dynamically when the user enters a value between 0-255 for red, green or blue. Unfortunately the opacity is set at 1 and cannot be altered at the moment; however that will change once I figure a way out. This can be a fun way to learn about colors or to choose the right background color for the your project!
